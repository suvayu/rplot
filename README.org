* Introduction
This project provides a few Python libraries to easily plot ROOT
objects.

- ~rdir~ :: interface to browse multiple ROOT files.
- ~rplot~ :: interface to plot ROOT objects.
- ~rplotsh~ :: script to interactively browse multiple ROOT files,
     read objects, and plot them.
- ~r2mpl~ :: ROOT to matplotlib translation layer.


* Installation
At the moment there are no install scripts.  So all you need to do
is add a symlink to the python script rplotsh.py somewhere in your
path.  This is what I do:

#+begin_example
  $ export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
  $ ln -s ~/bin/rplotsh /path/to/repo/rplotsh.py
#+end_example

After the above steps, rplotsh should work from anywhere.


* Tasks
** rplotsh [0/5]
*** TODO Plotting
: plot <object> | <list>
*** TODO Plot settings
: set grid ...
: set linestyle | linecolour | linewidth ...
: set stack
: set legends ...
*** WInP Manipulate objects in memory [1/2]
- [X] list objects
  : lsmem [memobj]...
- [ ] move objects to container
  : mv <memobj>... <container>
*** Inspect objects in the file
: cat | print [-v] <obj>
- For histograms, graphs, etc, show contents
- For trees, show branch information
*** TODO Tree commands
- Inspect (range of) entries, branches
- Looping constructs
- Splicing trees into subtrees by selection.  How to do this?
  - entrylist: book keeping
  - clonetree: possible memory issues
*** TODO RooFit commands
- Browse workspace

** Rplot [2/4]
*** TODO Line style, width
*** TODO Marker style, size
*** DONE Automatic legends

    :LOGBOOK:
    - State "WInP"       from "TODO"       [2015-05-23 Sat 11:49]
    :END:
*** DONE Stack
    CLOSED: [2014-09-16 Tue 16:22]

** r2mpl [0/1]
*** TODO Translate ROOT histogram to numpy array
Histograms in ~mpl~ still retain the dataset granularity, whereas it
is lost in ROOT.  Need to fake this behaviour during conversion.
